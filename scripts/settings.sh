# Reconcile this repo's own (non-org-level) GitHub settings from version
# control. The desired repo-level ruleset lives in .github/rulesets/main.json
# (GitHub's native ruleset format); this script diffs it against the live
# ruleset (--check) or applies it (--apply).
#
# Org-wide rules (the org `default-branch` ruleset) live in ~/github-settings
# and are managed with tofu — this script never touches them. The two layers
# compose; GitHub enforces the most restrictive.
#
# Array ORDER is not compared. GitHub decides it — an applied rule comes back
# appended to the end of `rules` rather than in any canonical order, so a rule
# written anywhere but last in main.json used to report drift immediately after
# an --apply that had in fact succeeded (observed 2026-08-11 on
# ojhermann-org/agpalindrome-aws). normalize() now sorts every array on both
# sides, so the committed file may list rules, bypass actors and required
# status checks in any order.
#
# The cost, stated plainly: if GitHub ever gives an array in a ruleset a
# meaning that depends on its order, this diff will not see a change to it.
# Nothing in the current schema is known to work that way — rules all apply and
# none is first-match — but that is reasoning about the schema, not a guarantee
# from it.
#
# Run it yourself: it uses your `gh` auth (repo admin required). It is
# deliberately owner-run, not wired into CI, so settings never change silently.
#
# Requires: gh (authenticated), jq.
